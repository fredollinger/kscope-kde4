/**
 * Defines the main window of KScope.
 * The main window has both UI and functional tasks. As a window, it is
 * composed of three parts:
 * 1. The editing area (EditorTabs - a tab widget with editor pages)
 * 2. The project pane (FileList - listing the files in the project)
 * 3. The query pane (QueryWidget - a tab widget with pages displaying query
 *    results in lists)
 * The main window also maintains the main menu, the toolbar and the status-
 * bar, and is responsible for handling all the actions connected to these
 * bars.
 * As the application's main class, it is responsible for managing projects
 * (using a ProjectManager object) and for running instances of Cscope
 * (through a CscopeFrontend object).
