Files are completed when all functions and vars have been implemented from original.

Also, this file is integrated into the regular project (linked, but not all functions need to be called yet.)

Also, minimal changes are made to allow us to compile against kde4.

newprojectdlg4.h newprojectdlg4.cpp
projectbase4.h projectbase4.cpp
cscopefrontend4.h cscopefrontend4.cpp
symboldlg4.h symboldlg4.cpp symbollayout4.h
